TMF 2954 Java Programming (Project)

## Project Completion Timeline
1 June 2023 - 25 June 2023 (Year 2 Semester 2)

## Project Description
Develop a UNI Budget Planner app (with Graphical User Interface using Java) that allows university students to track their income (i.e. scholarship, loan, part time jobs) and expenses. For each entry, the users can perform the CRUD operations (create (add), read (view), update (edit) and delete. Besides that, the app must also have two more advanced functionalities that are summary of expenses based on type of expenses (for example and  a graph visualisation that display the usersâ€™ daily or monthly expenses. Txt file is allowed to be used for data management in this project as it will not be assessed. There is NO NEED for user login and password.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
